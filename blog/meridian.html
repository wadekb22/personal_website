                Last June, I returned to Meridian Bank for a second summer as an intern. Among other projects, one other intern and I were tasked with using the bank’s customer data to facilitate targeted marketing. We were given the freedom to approach this problem in any way but were encouraged to experiment with machine learning techniques.
                <br><br>
                This was my first experience programming any learning or categorization algorithm, however using online resources I managed to find my footing quickly. In the end, the two of us created algorithms for k-means clustering, PCA, and a deep feed-forward neural network in C#. Most of my time was spent writing and optimizing the neural network. I experimented with different cost functions and starting weight generations. In the end, we managed to achieve 85% accuracy with our structure on a handwritten character recognition sample set.  Although this isn’t very competitive with premade alternatives, it was a valuable experience to go through the entire creation process.
                <br><br>
                We never got a chance to work with the company’s actual data, however after speaking with our boss several months later, I learned they are trying to hire a new employee to continue where we left off.
                <br><br>
                I remain extremely grateful to Meridian Bank for continually welcoming me to work there and giving me the freedom to approach this project at my own pace and in my own way.
